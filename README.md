# Emergent Quantum Field Theory (E-QFT) — Simulations
**Repository:** E-QFT-Team/E-QFT_Simulations

---

## 🌌 Overview

This repository contains numerical simulations, validations, and analysis tools supporting the development of **Emergent Quantum Field Theory (E-QFT)**.  
E-QFT proposes a fundamental extension of standard quantum field theory based on a **non-factorizable global Hilbert space**, from which particles, interactions, and spacetime itself emerge through coherent local projections.

## 📚 About E-QFT

Emergent Quantum Field Theory (E-QFT), also known by its French acronym TQC-E (*Théorie Quantique des Champs Émergente*), redefines the foundations of quantum fields by introducing:
- A single global quantum field structure (\( \mathcal{H}_G \))
- Intrinsic coherence underlying entanglement and interactions
- Emergent gauge symmetries (U(1), SU(2), SU(3))
- Topological protection mechanisms against decoherence
- A natural framework for the emergence of spacetime geometry

Numerical validations demonstrate local equivalence with standard QFT (deviations \( < 10^{-6} \)), while predicting measurable topological effects.
